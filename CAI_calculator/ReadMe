This folder contains the code and file for calculating the genomic codon adaptaion index (CAI) scores for E. coli and anaerobic fungus Piromyces indianae

This code was adapted for whole genome analysis using the from CodonAdaptationIndex code by Benjamine Lee (https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/CodonAdaptationIndex)

This code takes all CDS for a genome/organism of interest and uses the high expressing genes (HEG) for the heterologous expression host to cacluate the CAI score for each gene in the genome

In the code, the files partaining to the CDS and HEG need to be replaced (along with accurate file locations) for the organism(s) of interest. Files much be in fasta format.

Code written for python 3.6 or later
Code variable:
fasta_file = file containin all CDS for the host or source genes (E. coli or P. indianae) 
- For this analysis, this was either 'E_coli_CDS.txt'  OR  'Piromy1_GeneModels_FilteredModels2_cds.fasta'

ref_seqs = file containing high expressing genes sequences for heterologous expression host (E. coli in this case)
- For this analysis, this was 'e_coli-HEG.fasta'
